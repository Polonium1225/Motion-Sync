This is a new **React Native** project, built using **Expo**.

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) guide before proceeding.

### Step 1: Install Expo CLI

If you haven't installed Expo yet, you need to install the Expo CLI first. Open your terminal and run:

```sh
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Alternatively, you can use `yarn` if you prefer:

```sh
yarn global add expo-cli
```

### Step 2: Initialize the Project

To start the project using Expo, run the following command from the root of your project:

```sh
expo start
```

This will start the Expo development server. The Expo DevTools will open in your browser.

### Step 3: Build and Run the App

With the development server running, you can now run your app. You have a few options here:

- **On your phone**: Open the **Expo Go** app (available on both Android and iOS) and scan the QR code shown in your terminal or Expo DevTools. Your app will load directly on your device.
  
- **On an emulator or simulator**: If you have **Android Studio** or **Xcode** set up, you can press `a` for Android or `i` for iOS to open the app in the respective emulator or simulator.

### Step 4: Modify Your App

To make changes to the app, open `App.js` (or `App.tsx` if using TypeScript) in your editor. When you save your changes, the app will automatically update — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

To force a reload, press:
- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu** (accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Windows/Linux or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in the iOS Simulator.
